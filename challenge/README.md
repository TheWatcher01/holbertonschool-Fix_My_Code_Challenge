# Fix My Code Challenge

## Description

This project is focused on debugging and fixing existing code in various programming languages. The goal is to identify and correct issues in pre-written code without rewriting the entire implementation.

## Background Context

- This is a debugging project where we work with existing codebases
- The languages may or may not be familiar
- The focus is on finding and fixing bugs, not rewriting code from scratch
- This project is entirely optional and can add extra credit to your average score

## Environment

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

## Project Tasks

### 0. FizzBuzz

- Fix Python implementation of FizzBuzz
- Current bug: Number 15 prints "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz"
- File: `0-fizzbuzz.py`

### 1. Print Square

- Fix JavaScript implementation of square printing
- Current bug: Incorrect square size output
- File: `1-print_square.js`

### 2. Sort

- Fix Ruby implementation of argument sorting
- Current bug: Sorting implementation not working as expected
